## Overview

This project is a learning exercise to enhance understanding of React.js and React Router. It uses Vite to set up a React + JavaScript project, with Tailwind CSS for styling and JSON Server for backend data fetching. The UI is inspired by the official React website and is fully responsive.

## Project Features

- **React for Front-end**: Utilizes React.js for building the front-end.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed for efficient and modern styling.
- **JSON Server**: Used for simulating a backend by fetching data from a JSON file.
- **React Router**: Implemented for creating routes to multiple pages.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and mobile-friendly, inspired by the official React website.

  "server": "json-server *file-location* --port *port*"
}
```

Run JSON Server with the following command:

```bash
npm run server
```

## Install Tailwind CSS

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Configure Your Template Paths

Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```jsx
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {

## Add the Tailwind Directives to Your CSS

Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Start the Development Server

Use the following command to start the build process:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Front-End Development

Front-end development involves creating the elements of a website that users interact with directly.

### HTML

- **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)**: The standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of HTML elements defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets.

### CSS
